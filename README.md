# PyTorch
In this project I have explored and identified the Design and Security Patterns followed by the JIT compiler module in PyTorch Library.

I have also added a new feature where we can visualize the difference between PyTorch and TorchScript runtimes.
Details about JIT compiler: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html
